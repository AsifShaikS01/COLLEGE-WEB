     We are being a part of Indian Education system from 1860 (162 Years ago) as a Sanskrit School. Later it was transformed to Town High School i.e., Hindu High School Guntur.

At the peak of Independence movement of our nation, Dr.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the then Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University and later the President of India inaugurated the Hindu college in 1935, <BR>
with a few Science and language courses under the management of Hindu College and High Schools Council Society from which HIndu College Committee provides regular Administration.<BR>

After having 11 Institutions including several professional colleges, to provide and to be part of Technical / Engineering education in the modern society, we have established Hindu College of Engineering and Technology<BR>
at Center of city, Amaravathi Road, Guntur a decade ago.We as a team of experienced people look forward to provide “Skill Based Technical Engineering Education” to all the students coming around from different places of the country.<BR>
  To develop the students’ knowledge we are equipped with experienced faculty and modern lab facilities.
